# iv1351-course-planning-database-SQL-


This repository contains a relational database project developed as part of the IV1351 Data Storage course.

The project focuses on designing and implementing a database that supports course layout planning and teaching load allocation at a university. It includes SQL scripts for:
	•	Database schema creation
	•	Data insertion
	•	Analytical (OLAP) SQL queries for reporting and statistics

The database is designed to model courses, course instances, teaching activities, departments, employees, and allocations, and to support queries related to planned hours, allocated teaching load, and workload analysis.
